Unbestowed to many, Burp has amazing passive gathering capabilities that allows to easily discover sub domains related to a target you're assessing. These often only come up after browsing and using the target features extensively. Some of them are only linked - i.e. are not necessarily requested, which make them even more interesting for recon purposes.
